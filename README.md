# PINN for Transient MHD Flow and Heat Transfer
This repository implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model and solve transient magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow and heat transfer over a nonlinearly stretching surface. The approach integrates deep learning with the governing PDEs of fluid dynamics and heat transport to approximate solutions efficiently.
