# PINN for Transient MHD Flow and Heat Transfer
This repository implements Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model and solve transient magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) flow and heat transfer over a nonlinearly stretching surface. The approach integrates deep learning with the governing PDEs of fluid dynamics and heat transport to approximate solutions efficiently. PINNs add physical conservation laws and prior physical knowledge to the existing Neural Network by constraining the loss function of neural network approximations, which substatially reduces the training data and can build a model capable of dealing with more general cases while attaining maximum accuracy.
